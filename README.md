# RBDO of load sharing systems
The Reliability–Based Design Optimization (RBDO) of load sharing systems is computationally intensive due to the dynamic nature of component failure probabilities, since the failure of one component will vary the failure probabilities of other working components. Many RBDO methods have been successfully utilized to design individual components, however using these methods for handling system level reliability constraints is still a challenging task. This is because of a drop in accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when considering a load sharing system, where there is dependency in failure probabilities of components. The key idea is to integrate Stress–Strength Interference (SSI) theory with discrete (or) continuous time-discrete state Markov model for the reliability assessment of system, with the states being the condition of components (working/failed). This method takes advantage of the state transition probability matrix to represent the dynamic nature of the system performance. A numerical example of a simple load sharing system with two I-Beams is presented to illustrate and evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology.

### Note:
The Matlab code is available in the code section along with the data used for this study. Please note that the algorithm has a problem with convergence to a global optimum. The user is suggested to try with different optimization algorithm which has good convergence criteria.
